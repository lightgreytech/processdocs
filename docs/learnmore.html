											<h1>Hi, I'm Jakes,<br />
											welcome to LightGrey Tech</h1>
											<p>Documenting my processes for Tech Enthusiast</p>
										</header>
										<p>On here, I provide "easy-to-follow-along" tech documentations, that serve as guidelines for solving similar tech challenges I've encountered. And also provide tutorials for fresh minds working with replica/same situations in various topics; like Networking, Virtualization, Devops, Containers, Linux systems, Cyber Security and Datacenter technologies.<br>
											<br>
											<br>
											Early on in my Career as a tech instructor with cisco networking academy, it was difficult finding suitable online resources to guide me through certain quick tasks, and a daunting process searching endlessly to nip little gaps in knowledge, this became even harder when I gravitated towards active field practice as Systems Engineer. I became responsible for a cluster of servers; implementation of virtualization technologies; creation, configuration and patching of VMs; hyperconverged infrastructure and implementation of DataCenter best practices. This awareness birthed the idea behind this platform and the choice to document my processes going forward and publish them to help anyone who needs help at any particular time.										</p>
