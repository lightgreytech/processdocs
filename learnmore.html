											<h1>Hi, it's Jakes<br />
											from LIGHTGREY TECH</h1>
											<p>Documenting my processes for Tech Enthusiast</p>
										</header>
										<p>This platform is dedicated to providing "easy-to-follow-along" tech tutorial and documentations. I will publish my processes as I attempt to walk through seemingly challenging tasks and hopefully that will give some insight if you are in similar situations or faced with similar challenges.<br>
											Topics will range from networking to virtualization, devops, containers, linux systems, cyber security and datacenter technologies.
											<br>
											<br>
											I started out actively in tech as a Cisco Networking Academy instructor and quickly transitioned into Systems Engineering as I became responsible for a cluster of servers; implementation of virtualization technologies; creation, configuration and patching of VMs; hyperconverged infrastructure and implementation of DataCenter best practices. Being aware of how difficult it could get sometimes to find online resources to guide one through certain quick task (and I have been there a lot), I figured it'd be a great idea to document my processes going forward and publish them to help anyone who needs help at any particular time.
